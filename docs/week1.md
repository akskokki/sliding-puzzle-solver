# Week 1 progress report

This week I researched potential topics for the project and set up the general structure of the repository and documentation. I decided to try and implement a solver for the 15 puzzle, as it felt like an interesting yet approachable challenge.

Work on the program itself has not yet begun beyond setting up poetry, but I've been reading up on the IDA\* algorithm and its potential applications for this particular puzzle.

Next week I plan to at the very least implement the basic functionality of the game itself, and hope to start proper work on the solving algorithm as well.

Time spent this week: ~3 hours
