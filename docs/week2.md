# Week 2 progress report

This week I mainly focused on brushing up on my pygame skills and getting the game itself running, as well as doing research on the potential heuristics I'll be able to utilise for algorithmically solving the puzzle.

The game is running with the ability for the user to move the tiles around and scramble the board by pressing spacebar. Explicit win-state not yet implemented.

At this stage it was difficult to implement very meaningful testing for the program, but this will improve as the program grows, especially once implementation of the solving algorithm begins. However, Pylint and autopep8 are in place for static code analysis.

Documentation of the code is not very good at the current stage, planning to add docstring documentation in the future.

Next week I intend to have some level of functional solving algorithm implemented. Additional focus will be given to improved testing and documentation.

Time spent this week: ~7 hours (4 hours programming, 3 hours research)
